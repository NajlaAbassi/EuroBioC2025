Please refer to the [conference schedule](schedule.qmd) for the date and time

Slides must be either publicly accessible online or uploaded to a shared Google

presenters to keep presentations simple (e.g., avoid animations where possible).

Conference delegates already scheduled to present a short talk or poster are
welcome to submit flashtalks.

We will post a link to a Google Form to submit a flash talk in this space.

In the issue, please provide information about the plan and intended outcomes
of the session, as well as the name and contact information of the organizer(s).
